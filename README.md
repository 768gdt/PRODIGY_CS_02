# PRODIGY_CS_02
Encryption and Decryption: The XOR operation is used to manipulate pixel values. The same key is used for both encryption and decryption, making it symmetric.

User Input: Users can input the path to the image they want to encrypt or decrypt, the path where the output image should be saved, and the encryption/decryption key.

Running the Program: The program asks the user whether they want to encrypt or decrypt the image, and then performs the operation based on their input.
